## belt-loop-buckle.scad

This is a rigid buckle with a middle piece that threads through belt loops, and outer loops, designed to retain belts made of soft fabric. This keeps the fabric straight (instead of letting it bunch up), and makes it possible to thread belts with large clasps / buckles on each end that would otherwise be impractical to thread through belt loops.

They were designed for use with an elastic [GO Belt (as sold by Meh)][GOBELT], which is what I wore before I moved toward just tactical belts.
